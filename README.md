## Your Activites

Now that you've have some significant practice, here's what you need to do for this lab. Make sure to use the **CommandLine interface on your local machine** to complete this operations (**don't use web-based commits as you need to learn and practice the Git commands**).

1. Clone this repo to your local machine (I would **strongly** suggest using the commandline version of the shell). (see https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
2. Create a branch called **greeting** and switch to this branch and change to the `src` folder. If you run `git status` what is the output of this and why (create a file called `answer.txt` on this branch and add your answer to it (just don't copy/paste in the output but answer the question)? [1 mark]
3. Create a file called `greeting.txt`. Add a message to the file. [1 mark]
4. Add `greeting.txt` and `answer.txt` files to staging area and commit (with appropriate message). [1 mark]
5. What is the output of `git branch`? Add the output of this to a file called branch.txt, add the file to staging and commit (with appropriate commit message). [1 mark]
6. What is the output of `git log --oneline --graph --all` (Just for your own learning)
7. Create a branch called **readme** and switch to this branch (still in the src folder). [1 mark]
8. Create a `README.md` file using GitHub Markdown (https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). Add some content using at least one header [+0.5], a list [+0.5], emphasis [+0.5] and a hyperlink [+0.5]. Add `README.md` to the staging area and commit (with the appropriate message). [+1]
9. Push your changes upstream to GitHub.
10. Create a PR (Pull Request) to merge both branches into the `master` branch (note: this is done on GitHub). [+1]
11. Review and merge the changes (both of these items should end up in the `src` folder on the `master` branch (there should be no conflicts as they are different files) (note: this is done on GitHub and normally someone else would do the review, but here the goal is to just be able to complete the review process). [+1]

These steps are important to become familar with as we will be working with this flow on a regular basis.
